Core Concepts

Dynamic Precision
Start learning from binary (yes/no) representations, and gradually increase precision based on learning feedback. Applies only during the learning phase.

Dynamic Connectivity
Each node autonomously decides which other nodes to connect to. The connection structure is optimized during both learning and usage.

Dynamic Quantity
The number of active nodes is dynamically determined based on available computational resources. Applies to both learning and usage.
